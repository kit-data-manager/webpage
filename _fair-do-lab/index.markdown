# The {{ page.title }}

The {{ page.title }} is a configurable structure of services to fulfill generic FAIR Digital Object (FAIR DO) use cases. It is a proposal for research which can be configured and extended to specific needs. As the {{ page.title }} is easy to run on local computers and its default configuration offers a sandboxed PID service, it is therefore also suited to serve developers as a testing environment.

As its core, it uses the [Typed PID Maker], which then will notify other services about its actions, so they can automatically react to those. For example, an indexer service will put new or changed record information into a search engine without any human interaction required.

The FAIR DO Lab is based on its predecessor, the FAIR DO Testbed, which was [introduced at the RDA Virtual Plenary 17 Poster](https://doi.org/10.5445/ir/1000131613) Session. In contrast to it, the FAIR DO Lab aims for production ready software rather than experimentation.

## Features

* All features of the [Typed PID Maker], including creation, updating and resolving PIDs
* Supporting development and training, due to its sandboxed default configuration
* Configurable services, which can be omitted if not required
* (Optional, default) Extendable architecture due to the established message broker "RabbitMQ", where services get all information about the situation
* (Optional, default) Automated indexing of PID records using Elasticsearch

## Roadmap

Currently, the {{ page.title }} contains services which are not production-ready. While the development can be followed on GitHub, here are the most important points which are planned in near future:

* **The [Typed PID Maker] must reach version 1.0.** – Ideally, all services should be production-ready, but as the [Typed PID Maker] is a vital part of the {{ page.title }}, we consider its stability as a requirement for production use. As the {{ page.title }} is a living proposal, we do not have this requirement for all the services, but we offer [explicit documentation about the status of the different components](status.html).

* **Stable and flexible indexing process.** – Searching for FAIR DOs is an important use case. We consider the current indexing process to be a proof-of-concept. For a 1.0 release, we plan to make it more flexible and use it to extract even more information about FAIR DOs.
